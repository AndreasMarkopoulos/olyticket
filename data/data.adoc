= Data Directory for Ticket Scraper

This `data` directory is used to store persistent files related to the ticket scraping service.

== Purpose

* Stores `known_tickets.json`, which keeps track of previously scraped tickets.
* Ensures that new ticket listings can be detected without duplicating old ones.
* Helps maintain data persistence even when the application restarts.

== Persistence on Fly.io

* This directory is mounted as a *persistent volume* on Fly.io.
* The volume ensures `known_tickets.json` is *not lost* when the container restarts.
* Fly.io automatically attaches the volume to `/app/data`.

== Important Notes

* *Do not delete this directory* unless you want to reset the known ticket history.
* If running locally, ensure the `data` directory exists before starting the application.
